The "PasswordHelp" project is designed to help the user generate passwords for his needs, it can be a password for both social networks,
games, sites, various services, etc.
Many people cannot come up with interesting, complex and secure passwords for themselves, so the "PasswordHelp" service comes to the rescue.
All information about the passwords you have generated is strictly confidential and protected. Be careful every time you reload the page, the generated password is lost forever, so if this password suits you, keep it for yourself or send it to your mail to save it.

To use the service, you need to log in, if there is no account, the service offers quick registration and, as mentioned above, after logging in, the service allows you to send the generated password to your email.
